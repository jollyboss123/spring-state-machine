# Spring State Machine

The `spring-state-machine` repository is an open-source project that provides an implementation of a state machine framework using Spring Framework. State machines are a popular way to model and implement complex workflows, especially in applications with multiple states and transitions.

### Features
Some key features of this framework include:

* Spring integration: The framework is designed to be integrated with the Spring Framework, making it easy to use in Spring-based applications.
* Hierarchical state support: The framework supports hierarchical states, allowing for complex state machine models to be created.
* Transition actions: Actions can be associated with state transitions, allowing for additional logic to be executed when a state transition occurs.
* State entry/exit actions: Actions can also be associated with state entry and exit events, allowing for additional logic to be executed when a state is entered or exited.
* State machine persistence: The framework supports persistence of the state machine, allowing for state machines to be resumed from where they left off in case of failure or restart.

### Getting started
To get started with the spring-state-machine framework, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/jollyboss123/spring-state-machine.git
2. Build the project: `mvn clean install`
3. Run the tests: `mvn test`
4. Start using the framework in your Spring application by including the necessary dependencies and configuring the state machine.
